[Code Challenges](https://www.codecademy.com/code-challenges)


1. [Calculate the Mean and Mode](https://github.com/EreminD/codeacademy_challenges/blob/main/CalculateTheMeanAndMode.js)
> Create a statsFinder() function that takes in a list of numbers and returns a list containing the mean and mode, in that order. As a reminder, the mean is the average of the values and the mode is the most occurring value. If there are multiple modes, return the mode that occurs first. Make sure that you write your functions and find these answers from scratch – don’t use imported tools!
> 
> For example, statsFinder([500, 400, 400, 375, 300, 350, 325, 300]) should return [368.75, 400].
2. [FizzBuzz](https://github.com/EreminD/codeacademy_challenges/blob/main/FizzBuzz.js)
> Write a fizzbuzz() function that takes in a number, n, and returns an array of the numbers from 1 to n. For multiples of three, use "Fizz" instead of the number, and for the multiples of five, use "Buzz". For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, use "FizzBuzz" (capitalization matters).
> 
> For example, fizzbuzz(16) should return [1, 2, 'Fizz', 4, 'Buzz', 'Fizz', 7, 8, 'Fizz', 'Buzz', 11, 'Fizz', 13, 14, 'FizzBuzz', 16].
3. [Maximize Stock Trading Profit](https://github.com/EreminD/codeacademy_challenges/blob/main/MaximizeStockTradingProfit.js)
> Given the daily values of a stock, create a function called maxProfitDays() that, given a list of integers, will return the index value of the two elements that represent the day on which one should have bought a share and the day on which one should have sold a share based on the max profit.
> A list of integers will represent the stock price at the beginning or “opening bell” of each day for a week. You are required to buy and sell only once. You also must buy a stock before selling it.
> 
> For example, given the list [17, 11, 60, 25, 150, 75, 31, 120], you can assume that index 0 represents day 0 and index 7 represents day 7. In this case, purchasing on day 1 and selling on day 4 would yield the most profit. If we were to call maxProfitDays([17, 11, 60, 25, 150, 75, 31, 120]), the function would return [1, 4].
4. [Prime Number Finder](https://github.com/EreminD/codeacademy_challenges/blob/main/PrimeNumberFinder.js)
> Create a primeFinder() function that takes in a number, n, and returns all the prime numbers from 1 to n (inclusive). As a reminder, a prime number is a number that is only divisible by 1 and itself.
> 
> For example, primeFinder(11) should return [2, 3, 5, 7, 11].
5. [Flatten an Array](https://github.com/EreminD/codeacademy_challenges/blob/main/FlattenAnArray.js)
> Write a function, flattenArray(), that takes in a 2-dimensional array, flattens it into a 1-dimensional array, and returns it. You can assume that you will only be given one or two-dimensional arrays
> 
> For example, flattenArray([1, 2, [3, 4, 5], 6, [7, 8], 9]) should return [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9].
6. [Unique Characters in a String](https://github.com/EreminD/codeacademy_challenges/blob/main/UniqueCharactersInAString.js)
> Write a uniqueCharacters() function that determines if any given string has all unique characters (i.e. no character in the string is duplicated). If the string has all unique characters, the function should return true. If the string does not have all unique characters, return false.
> 
> For example, uniqueCharacters("apple") should return false.
> 
> Note that if the function is called with an empty string (""), the program should return an error message.
